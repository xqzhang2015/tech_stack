# Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing

* https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7230.html

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-level request/response protocol that uses extensible semantics and self-descriptive message payloads for flexible interaction with network-based hypertext information systems.<br/>

This document is the first in a series of documents that collectively form the HTTP/1.1 specification:

1. "Message Syntax and Routing" (this document)
2. "Semantics and Content" [RFC7231](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7230.html#RFC7231)
3. "Conditional Requests" [RFC7232](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7230.html#RFC7232)
4. "Range Requests" [RFC7233](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7230.html#RFC7233)
5. "Caching" [RFC7234](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7230.html#RFC7234)
6. "Authentication" [RFC7235](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7230.html#RFC7235)

This HTTP/1.1 specification obsoletes RFC 2616 and RFC 2145 (on HTTP versioning).<br/>


This specification also updates the use of CONNECT to establish a tunnel, previously defined in RFC 2817, and defines the "https" URI scheme that was described informally in RFC 2818.<br/>
